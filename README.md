MUST READ: IMPORTANT - ONLY PAY attention to 2ndWEBPACK-PROJECT FOLDER. The rest I am trying to delete
 - 1st: IGNORE the WEBPACK2 FOLDER, it is only a duplicate of 2ndWEBPACK-PROJECT
 
 - 2nd: I am trying to find the way to delete that WEBPACK2 FOLDER
 
 - 3rd: 2ndWEBPACK-PROJECT is a project I loaded up to really understand webpack from tutorials
 
 - 4TH: Other files are actually the first project I loaded up, I just used that to navigate my way around WEBPACK
